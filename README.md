# SDV_coursework
This repository contains the code for my developed data visualisation for assignment 2 of the Introduction to Data Visualisation module. It attempts to help answer the research question "Analyse the development of house prices over time. Are there any detectable trends?".

This repository contains the following: 
 - a file "SDV_code.html" which contains the D3.js implementation of my data visualisation as a single and self-contained .html file.
 - a folder "Data_management". This folder consists of:
     - a folder "Data_preparations" which contains the Jupyter notebook files of Python code that was used to prepare the data for use in this assignment.
     - a folder "Formulated_datasets" which are the datasets produced as output from the data preparation phase.
     - a folder "Original_datasets" which are the datasets used as input to the data preparation phase.
